# Ingredients

- 1 pound flank steak
- 1 small white onion, quartered
- 2 garlic cloves
- 2 bay leaves
- 2 teaspoons black peppercorns
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- 2 cups water
- ½ tablespoon vegetable oil
- 1 cup Mexican chorizo or longaniza sausage, casing removed
- ½ cup pork chicharrónes, crumbled
- 12 corn tortillas, warmed
- White onion, chopped, for serving
- Cilantro, chopped, for serving
- Hot sauce, for serving
- Lime wedges, for serving

# Directions

1. In a large saucepan or Dutch oven, add the steak, white onion, garlic cloves, bay leaves, peppercorns, and salt. Pour the water over the ingredients and place the pot on the stovetop over medium-high heat.
2. Bring the liquid to a simmer, reduce the heat to medium-low, and cover the pot. Cook the meat until it is very tender, about 1½ hours.
3. Using tongs or a slotted spoon, remove the meat from the liquid and chop it into bite-sized pieces.
4. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, warm the oil. Add the chorizo to the hot pan and use a wooden spoon to break the sausage up into small pieces. Continue cooking the sausage until it is browned, about 5 minutes.
5. To the pan with the chorizo, add the chopped steak and chicharrónes and stir to incorporate. Transfer the campechano meat to a serving bowl.
6. Serve the meat family-style with warm corn tortillas, chopped white onion and cilantro, hot sauce, and lime wedges.
