- 2 ¾ cups all-purpose flour
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon baking powder
- 1 cup roasted, salted peanuts
- 16 tablespoons (2 sticks) butter, softened but still cool
- ¾ cup packed dark brown sugar
- ¾ cup granulated sugar
- 1 cup creamy peanut butter
- 2 large eggs
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1-2 bags of Hershey's Chocolate Kisses (any variety), wrappers removed

**DIRECTIONS**

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees and make sure an oven rack is positioned in the middle of the oven. Line two aluminum rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper, silpat liners or lightly grease with cooking spray. Set aside.
2. In a medium bowl, whisk together, 1 ¾ cups flour, salt, baking soda, and baking powder. In a food processor or blender, process the remaining 1 cup flour and 1 cup peanuts together until finely ground and well-combined. Stir the peanut flour mixture into the bowl with the flour, salt and baking soda/powder.
3. In a large bowl, beat the butter and sugars together with an electric mixer (hand mixer or stand mixer), until the mixture is light and fluffy, 1-2 minutes. Add the peanut butter and continue to beat until combined. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating after each addition, until incorporated, about 30 seconds, then beat in the vanilla, stopping to scrape down sides of bowl, if necessary. Reduce the mixer speed to low and add the flour mixture in two batches, mixing until incorporated. Cover the bowl and refrigerate the dough for about 30 minutes until it is fairly stiff.
4. Roll the dough into 1-inch balls and space 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets. Bake the cookies for 9-10 minutes, until the outsides are set and the edges are just barely beginning to crack. Working quickly, remove the sheet from the oven and press one Hershey Kiss into the center of each cookie. Return the baking sheet to the oven and bake for another 1-2 minutes, until the cookies are lightly golden and the Hershey Kiss is glistening (but not melted into a puddle).
5. Let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for 3-4 minutes before removing the cookies to a cooling rack to cool completely. Repeat with remaining dough and Hershey Kisses.
