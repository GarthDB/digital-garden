Makes 10-12 Servings

- 4 lbs. beef (2 lbs. chuck roast, 2 lbs. short rib)
- 3-4 cups water
- 6 dried chile guajillo
- 2 dried chile ancho
- 2 cups low-sodium beef broth (boiling)
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1 large onion, dry skin removed, chopped
- 1 tsp. dried oregano
- 1 tsp. dried thyme
- 1 clove
- ¼ whole cinnamon stick
- 1 Tbsp. beef bouillon
- 2 laurel leaves (or bay leaves)
- 2 Tbsp. cooking oil
- salt and pepper
- onions, cilantro, and lime, for garnish

Directions:

1. In a saucepan, bring your beef broth to a boil over high heat.
2. Heat large cast iron pan on the stove over medium heat.
3. Toast the chiles in the pan for 2-3 minutes over medium heat, turning
frequently, making sure they do not burn. (Discard and replace any burnt chiles.)
4. Toast the onion in the cast iron over medium for about 5 minutes until the onion starts to brown.
5. Transfer toasted chiles to a heatproof bowl, add 1 cup boiling beef broth, and
let the chiles soak for 5 minutes, or until pliable.
6. Remove the stems of the chiles and pull them open. Remove the yellow veins and seeds, then strain and reserve the broth.
7. Add the reserved broth, the chiles, onion, garlic, oregano, thyme, clove,
cinnamon, bouillon, and laurel leaves (or bay leaves) in a blender and
blend until smooth. Strain and set aside.
8. In the cast iron pan, heat two tablespoons of oil.
9. Chop your beef into medium cubes, then add salt and pepper to the meat. In the cast iron pan**,** sear the beef on all sides until the meat is brown, then transfer to the Dutch oven.
10. Add the strained chile mixture to the top of your meat in to the Dutch oven. Add enough beef broth to cover the meat.
11. Bring the Dutch oven to a simmer, then cook over medium heat for at least 3
hours, but up to 5 hours. (When it’s done cooking, the meat should be
tender enough to start falling apart with a fork.)
12. Skim grease
from the top. (Reserve this grease and use it as your cooking oil if
you’re planning on making quesabirria tacos.) Remove any bones and
gristle from the mixture before serving.
13. To serve, dish your
desired amount of meat into a bowl with spoonfuls of the consomé. Top
with finely diced onion, cilantro and lime serving with warm tortillas.
