Blend:

1med size jalape√±o (add more depending on how hot you want it)

1 clove of garlic

1 big lime or 2 little limes juiced

1 tomato

- blend this all together and mix with the following in a bowl

3 chopped medium tomatoes or equivalent of smaller tomatoes (on the vine best but just go with cheapest)

1/2 a med onion (yellow or white) chopped small

However much cilantro you like (we usually use most the bunch) chop it off the bunch or if you don't like the little stems take it off leaf by leaf.

Mix and add salt to taste.
