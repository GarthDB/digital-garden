### **INGREDIENTS**

- 4 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes
- 2 sticks (8 ounces) unsalted butter, at room temperature
- 1 ½ cups heavy cream
- 2 pounds grated Gruyère cheese
- 1 pound fresh mozzarella cheese, drained and grated
- Kosher salt
- Freshly ground white or black pepper

****INSTRUCTIONS****

1. **Cook the potatoes:** Peel the potatoes and cut into 1-inch cubes. Place the potatoes in a 4-quart pot and cover with cool water. Cover the pot and bring to a boil. Once boiling, uncover and reduce the heat slightly to maintain a simmer. Cook the potatoes until are fork-tender, about 15 minutes.
2. **Purée the potatoes:** Drain the potatoes and cool for about 5 minutes. Use a food mill, potato masher, or ricer to finely mash the potatoes, or pulse (but not process) the potatoes into a fine purée in a food processor fitted with the blade attachment. Return the puréed potatoes to the pot.
3. **Add the butter and cream:** Return the pot to medium heat. Add the butter and cream and stir until melted.
4. **Beat in the cheese:** Add the Gruyère and mozzarella and beat into the potatoes with a wooden spoon. Put some muscle into it until the cheese and potatoes come together and have a stringy, elastic texture.
5. **Season and serve:** Season with salt and pepper as needed and serve warm.
