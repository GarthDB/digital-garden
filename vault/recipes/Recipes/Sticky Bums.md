# Ingredients

- ½ package little boxes of Stovetop cook Butterscotch pudding (not all grocery stores have it) Not Instant
- ¾ cup brown sugar
- ¾ stick butter
- ½ cup chopped nuts (we like pecan)
- ½ tsp cinnamon (optional)
- 2 Tbs corn syrup
- ½ tsp vanilla
- 11-18 Rhodes Rolls

# Directions

Night before you want to eat them you set out your rolls in sprayed 9x13 with sprayed plastic wrap over. we let them get soft (takes about an hour) and then with kitchen scissors you cut them into 4ths. this way you'll have little nuggets of dough mixed in with the mixture and not huge rolls. Mix ingredients below and evenly disperse over and in between cut roll dough. Recover with the sprayed plastic wrap and put in cool place so they don't rise too fast while you sleep. Don't put it in the fridge. We usually do cold oven.

Let butter soften at room temperature and then mix everything minus the rolls with a hand mixer till its all incorporated and its a brown play dough like glob

350 degrees for 10-15 min, you have to watch them, you want the tops to be good and brown so the bottoms get all the way cooked. When done Cameron likes to flip it out on to a cookie-sheet so that all the rolls get nice and coated in goodness. It's easy to Double and we usually do if anyone is visiting.
