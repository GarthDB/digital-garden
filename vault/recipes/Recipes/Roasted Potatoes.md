## Ingredients

- 2 1⁄2 tiny new potatoes
- 2 tablespoons fresh thyme leaves
- 2 teaspoons garlic, chopped
- 2 tablespoons beef tallow or coconut oil

## Directions

Preheat oven to 450°F and place a backing pan on the rack in the lower third.
Toss together all ingredients in a bowl; season with salt and pepper.
Carefully transfer potatoes to the hot pan, shaking the pan to spread potatoes into a single layer.
Roast potatoes, occasionally stirring, until tender and crispy (about 35 minutes).
