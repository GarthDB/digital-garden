- 1 ¾ cups of sugar
- 1 tbs cinnamon
- 2 ½ cups flour
- 2 tsp cream of tartar
- 1 tsp baking soda
- ½ tsp salt
- 1 stick butter (unsalted)
- ½ cup vegetable shortening (crisco)
- 2 large eggs

1. Heat oven to 375º. Combine 1/4 cup of the suar and the cinnamon in a shallow dish.
2. Whisk the flour, cream of tartar, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl.
3. Beat the butter, shortening, and remaining 1 1/2 cups of sugar in a large bowl with electric mixer until light and fluffy.
4. Beat in eggs. Reduce mixer speed to low and slowly blend in dry ingredients until just combined.
5. Roll 2 tbs dough into balls, roll in cinnamon sugar and place on cookie sheet.
6. Bake 10-12 minutes.

- 3 candy canes
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- ½ teaspoon cinnamon
- ¼ cup all-purpose flour

1. Heat oven to 350°F.
2. Place the candy canes in a heavy-duty zip top bag. Using a hammer or something heavy, hit the candy canes to break until they are fine crumbs.
3. In a small bowl, combine the crushed candy canes with the sugar and cinnamon.
4. Place the cookie dough in a medium bowl and break into chunks. Add in the flour and mix until combined. Reshape the dough back into a log and cut into 32 equal pieces.
5. Roll each piece into a ball and then roll in the candy cane/sugar/cinnamon mixture. Place on a baking sheet, placing 2-inches apart.
6. Bake for 10-14 minutes, or until the edges are slightly brown. Remove from oven and cool for 1 minute on baking sheet before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
