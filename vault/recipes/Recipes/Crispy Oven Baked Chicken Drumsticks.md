- 4 pounds of bone in skin on chicken
- 2/3 cup flour
- 2 teaspoon salt
- 3 teaspoons paprika
- 2 teaspoons garlic powder
- 3/4 teaspoon pepper
- 3 tablespoons baking powder
- [butter flavor non-stick cooking sprayaffiliate](http://amzn.to/2wRzy4Y)
- kosher salt

## **Instructions**

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Line a large baking sheet with foil and set a baking rack on top if you have one. If you don’t have a baking rack just spray the foil with nonstick cooking spray.
2. Pat chicken dry, leaving skin in tact, and set aside.
3. In a large zip-top bag, combine flour, baking powder, salt, paprika and black pepper. Place the chicken in the bag a few pieces at a time and shake to coat. Set chicken pieces skin side down on the baking rack that has been placed on top of the baking sheet (or on the foil lined baking sheet that’s been sprayed with nonstick cooking spray). Place larger pieces toward the outside; pieces can be close together but should not touch. Spray pieces generously and evenly with butter flavored non-stick cooking spray.
4. Bake in the preheated 425 degree oven for 45-50 minutes, turning over after 30 minutes. Spray again with the cooking spray after turning. Juices should be clear and temperature should register 165 degrees. If you are not happy with the color you can turn on the broiler for a few minutes, just watch closely to ensure the chicken doesn't burn.
5. Cool slightly before serving.
