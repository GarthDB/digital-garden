## **Ingredients**

### Marinade

- 3 pounds beef short ribs, off the bone
- 1 cup soy sauce
- ½ cup mirin
- ½ cup dark brown sugar
- ¼ cup sesame oil
- 6 cloves garlic
- 6 scallions
- 2 teaspoons peeled and grated fresh ginger

### Korean-Style Slaw

- 3 cups roughly chopped Napa cabbage
- 1 cup matchstick-size daikon slices
- 3 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
- 6 scallions, diced

### Soy Lime Dressing

- 2 limes, juiced
- ¼ cup soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons mirin
- 2 tablespoons Sriracha
- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil

### Taco Assembly:

Twelve to fifteen 6-inch yellow corn tortillas or flour tortillas

Sriracha, for serving

### **Directions**

1. Cut off any excess fat from the short ribs, then thinly slice the beef and cut it into 1½-inch pieces. Place in a large bowl or a plastic resealable bag.
2. In a blender or food processor, blend the soy sauce, mirin, sugar, sesame oil, garlic, scallions, and ginger. Pour half of the sauce over the short ribs, ensuring all the beef is covered. Seal tightly and marinate the short ribs in the refrigerator for at least 3 hours and up to 24 hours.
3. Place the other half of the marinade in a pan and reduce over medium heat, occasionally stirring, until the mixture is thick. Place in a serving bowl and reserve to drizzle on the tacos.
4. For the slaw: Place the cabbage, daikon, cilantro, and scallions together in a medium to large bowl.
5. For the dressing: In a small bowl, whisk together the lime juice, soy sauce, mirin, and Sriracha. Slowly whisk in the olive oil. Place the dressing in the fridge until ready to use.
6. Heat your griddle to high. Flash-cook the meat while simultaneously caramelizing the marinade. Place your short ribs on the griddle. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes and flip. Cook an additional 3 minutes, then wrap the meat in foil and set aside.
7. Grill up your tortillas. Flip after 45 seconds. Grill for another 45 seconds and remove.
8. On the grilled tortillas, pile some Korean slaw, dressing, beef, reserved and reduced marinade, and extra Sriracha to taste. Then, chow down.

**Cook’s Note** If you can’t find short ribs, you can substitute with tri-tip.
