## Ingredients

- 2 pounds chicken wings (tips removed, separated into wingettes and drumettes)
- 1 Tbsp BAKING POWDER (whatever you do, do NOT use baking soda)
- 1-2 tsp kosher salt (plus more to taste)
- Favorite Buffalo wing sauce for tossing or serving on the side
Or a mix of favorite hot wing sauce and BBQ sauce, my new favorite

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 450F
2. Dry chicken with a paper towel really well. Place the wings in a large bowl. Sprinkle baking powder over the wings. Toss until all wings are evenly covered in baking powder. Better yet, mix by hand to ensure even coverage.
3. Line a large baking sheet with aluminum foil. Place a cooling rack (see note) on top and spray with Pam or rub with cooking oil to prevent sticking.
4. Lay the chicken wings on the rack, leaving space between the wings.
5. Place the baking sheet in the oven. Turn the heat down to 425F and set the mode to convection.
6. Bake for 30-40 minutes, until the wings are nicely browned and crisp.
7. Season with salt. Serve hot, tossed in Buffalo sauce or with the sauce on the side.

Tip: Let the wings sit for 5 minutes before tossing in sauce. This will preserve crispy skin.

### Notes

While a cooling rack helps with getting the melted chicken drain off the wings, it's a major pain getting it cleaned afterwards. I stopped using a cooling rack and bake the wings on parchment paper. I don't notice much difference, if any.
