## Equipment / Supplies

- A smoker (I’ve only tried this on a pellet smoker)
- Pellets (competition mix, oak, pecan, or mesquite pellets)
- [Peach paper](https://a.co/d/fHGN1Y5) (butcher paper or parchment if that’s all you can find)
- A small sharp knife for trimming the fat. The [Veark TRK07 Forged Turning knife](https://veark.com/collections/all-products/products/trk07-turning-knife) is my current favorite for this job.
- A large knife for carving the finished brisket. Many people use a serrated bread knife, but a chef’s knife or cleaver should work just as well.

## Ingredients

### Rub

- ½ Cup freshly ground black pepper
- 3 Tbsp. Seasoned salt like Lawry’s Seasoned Salt
- 3 Tbsp. Kosher salt
- 1 Tbsp. Granulated garlic

### Binder

- 1 part pickle juice
- 1 part yellow mustard (don’t get fancy, it won’t impact flavor)

## Directions

### Prepare the meat

Mix all ingredients together in a bowl or spice container. An empty spice container with holes in the lid works great for storage and easy sprinkling.
Make your spice rub the day before to let the flavors come together. The longer it sits the better it gets, to a point.

Trim the fat off the brisket where it is thicker than ¼ inch.

With a paper towel pat the brisket dry. Rub it down with the binder first before sprinkling the rub on. See above for rub recipe.

### Smoking the brisket

Preheat pellet grill or smoker to high smoke or 225 degrees F.

Put brisket in the smoker, fat side up and smoke until internal temperature reaches 160 degrees F (about 8-10 hours). Remove from smoker and wrap brisket in peach paper and continue smoking until internal temperature reaches between 190 - 201 degrees F (about 2-3 hours). Let brisket rest in for ½ - 1 hour and then carve and eat. If you need wait longer to eat, put it in a cooler to keep it from cooling down too much.

**Pro tip**: Depending on the size of your brisket, smoking time may vary. Always go by internal temperature to get best results; to truly check if it’s ready, use the ice pick method: use a temperature probe to puncture the peach paper, and then stab the brisket from several angles to see how easily it slides in. When the meat provides little resistance, it should be good to pull off.

### Carving and Serving the Brisket

Slice the flat from the point. Slice the flat parallel to that first cut.

Cut the point in half, perpendicular to the first separating cut and slice parallel to that second cut.

The far sides of the point tend to have great seasoning and flavor.
