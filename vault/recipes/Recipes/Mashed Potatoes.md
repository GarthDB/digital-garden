- ½ cup unsalted butter, cubed, cold
- 2 teaspoons kosher salt
- freshly ground black pepper, to taste

**Preparation**

1. On a cutting board, peel the potatoes. Place the potatoes in a large bowl of cold water after peeling to avoid discoloration.

4. In a small saucepan, bring the milk, heavy cream, and garlic to a simmer over low heat.
5. Remove the pot from the heat and strain the cream through a fine mesh sieve.
6. Drain the potatoes in a colander and transfer back to the pot.
7. Mash the potatoes with a potato masher, potato ricer, or by pushing through a fine mesh sieve with a spatula.
8. Add the cubed cold butter and salt. Stir to combine.
9. Gradually add the cream mixture to the potatoes, little by little, until fully incorporated.
10. Top with freshly ground black pepper and sprinkle with chives and serve.
11. Enjoy!
