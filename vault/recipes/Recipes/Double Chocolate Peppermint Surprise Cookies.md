1. 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2. 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
3. 1/2 cup granulated sugar
4. 1/4 cup light brown sugar
5. 1 teaspoon salt
6. 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
7. 1 1/2 sticks (6 oz) unsalted butter, slightly softened
8. 1 egg
9. 24 miniature (about 1 1/2-inch) peppermint patties, unwrapped and chilled
10. 6 oz. white chocolate, chopped peppermint candy canes or peppermint candies, crushed or finely chopped

---

1. In an electric mixer, beat the flour, cocoa powder, both sugars, salt and baking soda on low speed. Beat in the butter, then beat in the egg. Lay out a large sheet of plastic wrap and turn the dough onto the wrap. Wrap up and refrigerate until firm, about 1 hour.
2. Preheat the oven to 350F. Line 2 cookie sheets with parchment paper.
3. Divide the dough into 24 equal pieces, about 1 tablespoon each. Working with one piece of dough at a time, cut the piece into 2 equal parts. Using your hands or on a work surface, flatten each piece into a circle, just larger than the peppermint patty. Put a peppermint patty on top of one piece, and put the other piece on top. Mold the dough around the peppermint patty with your hands, making sure there are no holes. Place on the baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining dough and peppermint patties.
4. Bake in teh preheated oven, rotating the pans halfway through, until just firm to the touch, about 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to cool.
5. Meanwhile, melt half of the white chocolate in a double boiler. Remove from the heat and stir in the other half, stirring continuously until the chocolate has completely melted and is smooth. Using a large spoon or a fork, drizzle the cookies with the white chocolate, and then sprinkle with some crushed candy cane.
